Done/Ignored/Fixed/Created/Removed/Tested (version numbers are internal for now):

versio 5 - 24.11.2019:
- Changed: Volume now adjusted by push buttons, not the rotary encoder. The encoder, while it worked, consumed a lot of resources and made everything else sluggish. 
- Changed: Shutdown code now does not pass OS type command
- Changed: Now using pygame to adjust volumes
- Added: All LEDs are defined and blinking once a second for now
- Added: All buttons are defined and doing what they should
- Removed: DAC and rotary encoder code
- Done: Enclosure and electronics
- Added: Syslog logging

version 4 - 14.08.2019: 
- Added: Amplifier code for TPA2016 i2c controlled amplifier. Currently powered via RPi, and this is causing clipping. 
- Removed: Initial volume setting. The new volume knob code sorts this out by default
- Removed: Some unecessary comments
- Added: Print is now caused by setting debug to True. Seems to speed up things not having to write to the terminal what is going on

Version 3 - 13.08.2019: 
- Removed: Volume buttons
- Added: SPI DAC for reading 10K pot for volume control

Version 2:
- Added: OS code to ensure system volume is 70%
- Added: Simple LED pulse code
- Done: Sorted out the final pinout
- Done: Temporarily set up to use push buttons for volume up/down as my rotary encoders were too inaccurate (many false readings)

Version 1:
- Created GitHub repo..updates will follow
